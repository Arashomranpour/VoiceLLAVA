Key Features:
LLM Integration: The notebook integrates with the LLava model (llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf) using the transformers library.
Voice and Image Processing: It processes audio input (through voice-to-text) and image input (through an image-to-text feature).
Gradio Interface: A web-based UI built using Gradio, enabling users to interact via microphone and image uploads. The model processes both inputs and responds with text and audio.
TTS (Text-to-Speech): Uses the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert text back into audio.
